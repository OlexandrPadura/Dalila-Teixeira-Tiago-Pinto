A word cloud (tag cloud) is a representation of text data, typically used to depict
keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text.

- Write a program that will create a word cloud from the content of 5 or more files.
- You can use any text you like. 
- You are not required to visualize the tags; 
- you need to create a text file, which will contain the following information:
1. The words, ordered by frequency.
2. How many times the word appears.
3. Font size. The font size is calculated by the following simple rule:
a. The most frequent word should be –> Huge
b. > 60% (of max frequent word) –> Big
c. > 30% (of max frequent word) –> Normal
d. Less than 30% –> Small
4. The words that appear once should not be present.

Additional requirements:
The program should read all text files from the specific folder.
Read text files in different threads / tasks (in parallel).
One thread / task should read one file.
